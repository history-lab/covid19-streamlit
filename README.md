# covid19-streamlit
This repo contains the dashboard code, implemented using Streamlit, for the History Lab's COVID-19 prototype.

The History Lab's COVID-19 Archive aims to aggregate digitized documents related to the initial phases of the pandemic. In this prototype, we have processed the emails of Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. They are now divided into individual emails, which can be searched and sorted with the original metadata (from, to, subject, etc.) as well as new metadata we generated using topic modeling and named entity recognition.
